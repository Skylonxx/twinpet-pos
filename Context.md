# Twinpet POS — Project Context & System Rules

> Root context for all agents. Read this before `Task.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and role/skill docs.

---

## What this is

Twinpet is a **multi-branch pet retail ERP/POS** (2–3 branches). Single React codebase targeting web now and Capacitor native later.

**Core domains:** POS · Inventory · Receiving · Suppliers · Customers · Reports

**Production anchors:** Firebase project `twinpet-pos` · region `asia-southeast1` · Firestore database `pos-db`

---

## Non-negotiable system rules

1. **Inventory accuracy > speed.** Stock truth must not silently diverge.
2. **No duplicate source of truth.** One authoritative path per mutation.
3. **Prefer Firestore transactions** for stock changes that must be atomic.
4. **Every schema change** must consider existing collections and legacy docs.
5. **Multi-branch support must not break.** Branch scoping is a first-class constraint.
6. **Offline-first POS.** Checkout and destructive intents are client-first; server settlement is async. Never block checkout on stock verification. Use async-safe wording (`Pending sync`, not false “completed”).
7. **Oversell is allowed.** POS must not block a sale; reconciliation happens server-side.
8. **FIFO costing.** Stock cuts from `stockLots` ordered by `receivedAt` ASC. POS reads `productStocks.totalStockBase` — do not sum lots in the UI.
9. **Defense in depth.** Security must not rely on UI-only gates. Rules + server paths enforce authority.
10. **Do not assume correctness because it compiles.** Evidence required.

## Architecture mandates

- **Single React codebase** — no React Native rewrite; Capacitor for native shell when ready.
- **Offline durability:** browser IndexedDB + Firestore persistence today; native durable storage (e.g. Capacitor SQLite) planned for critical queues.
- **Server-authoritative settlement:** `reconcileOrder`, `resolveReversal`, `retryReconcile` own reconcile/reversal fields clients must not spoof.
- **Hardware later:** printer/scanner integrations behind adapter interfaces — no web-only assumptions baked into core logic.

## Agent workflow

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Roles | `docs/ai-roles/` | Who does what (developer, reviewer, tech-lead, …) |
| Skills | `docs/skills/` | Project-specific constraints (UI, rules, evidence, routing) |
| Reports | `docs/reports/latest-report.md` | Rolling phase history and evidence |
| Risks | `docs/reviews/baseline-risk-review.md` | Architecture risk baseline |

**Prompt routing:** Execute only when explicitly addressed (`TO: Cursor Agent`, `TO: Codex`, etc.). Naming a role file alone is not permission. See `AGENTS.md`.

**Developer gate:** Run `docs/skills/SKILL-DEVELOPER-SELF-REVIEW.md` before requesting Codex review.

**Reviewer gate:** Run Paranoid Checklist in `docs/ai-roles/reviewer.md` before approve/pass/close.

## Hard restrictions (unless Tech Lead / CEO explicitly approves)

| Do NOT | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Touch `stash@{0}` | Flowbite/UI migration WIP — conflict risk |
| Apply/drop/modify Flowbite stash | Same |
| Refactor transfer logic | Dedicated future track |
| Deploy / delete live functions | Environment-auditor + explicit approval only |
| Modify rules/functions outside approved scope | Security surface |
| Expand scope without approval | Scope discipline |

## Key offline-reversal concepts (Phase 7B)

- **7B-3D-2** — server resolver `functions/src/resolveReversal.ts` (unchanged in H2).
- **7B-3D-3** — client offline reversal queue + local IndexedDB correction + POS overlay.
- **7B-H1** — receiving header `reversalEvidence` snapshot (fail-closed at reversal).
- **7B-H2** — local `manual_review_resolved` transition so overlay drops after operator reconciliation.

---

## Evidence standard

Never claim success without proof. Reports must distinguish **passed / failed / not run / deferred**. See `docs/skills/SKILL-RELEASE-EVIDENCE.md`.
