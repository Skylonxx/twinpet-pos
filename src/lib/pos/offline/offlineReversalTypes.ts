/**
 * Offline Reversal Queue — shared types  [Phase 7B-3D-3]
 *
 * The client-side counterpart of the server `resolveReversal` resolver
 * (functions/src/resolveReversal.ts, Phase 7B-3D-2). When a cashier voids /
 * reverses a Goods-Receiving or branch Transfer while offline (or simply
 * optimistically), we must:
 *
 *   1. correct the device's LOCAL stock immediately (so selling can continue
 *      against accurate numbers), and
 *   2. durably queue the reversal INTENT so it survives reload/crash and later
 *      syncs to the authoritative server resolver.
 *
 * These types are intentionally pure data (no I/O, no Firestore types) so the
 * logic layer (offlineReversalLogic.ts) and the orchestration layer
 * (offlineReversalQueue.ts) can be unit-tested without a browser/IndexedDB.
 *
 * NOTE: this module is NOT wired into any live receiving/transfer/POS screen in
 * this phase (UI integration is explicitly deferred). It is the storage + sync
 * engine only.

 *                                rolled back. Terminal.
 *  - `manual_review_required`  — server rejected but rollback was unsafe (later local

 *                                server itself asked for manual reconciliation.
